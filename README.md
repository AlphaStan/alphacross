###What is this project ?

This is a collaborative project to build an AI playing board games with super human performances. It is currently under
development by [AnOtterGithubUser](https://github.com/AnOtterGithubUser) and [desrousseaux](https://github.com/desrousseaux).  
We do not necessarily aim to produce a state of the art AI (although it would be nice !). This project is mostly to explore RL (Reinforcement Learning) and 
deep RL and its applications to board games and to develop our coding skills. That is why you won't find many high level libraries in the requirements (specific to RL I mean). 
The idea is to develop an agent and environment, possibly several, from scratch (well we still use keras, numpy, and all the good stuff).

###How does this work ?

The most important part of the project is in the *src/* directory whose structure is as follows:  
+--_src  
   +--
